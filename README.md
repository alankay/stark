# Stark Messenger
An unofficial Signal App for Mac OS 10.15.7 onwards for users who don't want to update their mac on older hardware to be able to still use Signal.

## Why develop this?
On some devices I use older versions of Mac OS which prevent me from running Signal so I forked a version for Catalina to produce an unofficial app that allows Signal users to use older Mac OS versions with Signal
