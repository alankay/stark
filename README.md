# Stark Messenger
An unofficial Signal App for Mac OS 10.15.7 onwards for users who don't want to update their mac on older hardware to be able to still use Signal.

## Why develop this?
On some devices I use older versions of Mac OS which prevent me from running Signal so I forked a version for Catalina to produce an unofficial app that allows Signal users to use older Mac OS versions with Signal.

## Features
- Partial Signal functionality on macOS 10.15.7+
- Message sending & receiving

## Roadmap

### Enhanced Conversations View
- Emoji reaction support
- Enhanced delivery/read receipts

### UI Improvements  
- Dark/Light theme switching
- Resizable panels and adjustable fonts
- Smooth view transitions
- Circular avatars with status indicators
- Improved typing indicators
- Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts

### Technical Enhancements
- Faster message loading and scrolling
- Background sync
- Better memory management for older hardware

### Future Possibilities
- Voice message support
